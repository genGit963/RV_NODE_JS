Here are four new progressively difficult Node.js projects that can help you deepen your expertise and tackle real-world business challenges:

Challenge 1: URL Shortener Service
Objective: Create a simple URL shortener service.
Requirements:
- Build a web application where users can submit a long URL to be shortened.
- Generate a unique identifier for each submitted URL and store it in a database (e.g., MongoDB).
- Implement a redirect feature that takes users to the original URL when they visit the shortened link.
- Add basic analytics to track how many times each shortened URL has been accessed.
Skills Practiced: URL routing, database operations, basic analytics, and handling user input.

Challenge 2: Personal Finance Tracker
Objective: Develop a personal finance tracking application.
Requirements:
- Create a RESTful API using Express.js to manage user accounts and financial transactions.
- Allow users to add, update, delete, and categorize transactions (e.g., income, expenses).
- Implement user authentication (JWT) to secure access to personal financial data.
- Provide a front-end interface (could be a simple React or Angular app) to visualize financial data using charts (e.g., monthly expenses, income vs. expenses).
Skills Practiced: User authentication, CRUD operations, data visualization, and working with financial data.

Challenge 3: Social Media API
Objective: Build a social media backend API.
Requirements:
- Design a RESTful API that allows users to create accounts, post updates, and follow other users.
- Implement features such as commenting on posts, liking posts, and displaying a feed of posts from followed users.
- Use a database to store user data and posts, and consider using Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- Add pagination to the API responses to manage large datasets efficiently.
Skills Practiced: Complex data relationships, pagination, caching, and user interaction features.

Challenge 4: Event Booking System
Objective: Create a backend system for managing event bookings (e.g., concerts, seminars).
Requirements:
- Develop a RESTful API using Express.js to handle events, bookings, and user accounts.
- Allow users to browse upcoming events, book tickets, and manage their bookings.
- Integrate a payment gateway for processing ticket purchases (e.g., Stripe).
- Implement real-time notifications (e.g., via WebSockets) to inform users about booking confirmations or changes in event details.
- Include an admin panel (a simple web interface) for managing events and monitoring ticket sales.
Skills Practiced: Event management, payment processing, real-time notifications, and building a more complex application with different user roles (admin vs. user).

 Summary of New Learning Projects
1. URL Shortener Service: Introduces concepts of unique identifiers and simple analytics.
2. Personal Finance Tracker: Adds user authentication and focuses on data management and visualization.
3. Social Media API: Explores relationships between data and user interactions.
4. Event Booking System: Combines multiple features, real-time notifications, and payment processing for a comprehensive application.

These projects will help you tackle more complex scenarios and deepen your understanding of Node.js and related technologies.
