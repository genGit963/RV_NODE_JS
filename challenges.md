Here is Node.js projects that can help you
deepen your expertise and tackle real-world business challenges:

Challenge 1: URL Shortener Service
Objective: Create a simple URL shortener service.
Requirements:

- Build a web application where users can submit a long URL to be shortened.
- Generate a unique identifier for each submitted URL and store it in a database (e.g., MongoDB).
- Implement a redirect feature that takes users to the original URL when they visit the shortened link.
- Add basic analytics to track how many times each shortened URL has been accessed.
  Skills Practiced: URL routing, database operations, basic analytics, and handling user input.

Based on the comprehensive Node.js learning path, here are five progressively challenging tasks to help you become an expert in Node.js. These challenges are designed to cover core concepts, advanced techniques, and real-world applications, pushing your knowledge to the expert level:

## Challenge 3: Build and Optimize a Node.js Native C++ Addon

- **Objective:** Create a native C++ addon to optimize a computationally expensive task in your Node.js application.
- **Skills to Focus On:**
  - Writing and integrating C++ code using Node-API or C++ Addons.
  - Performance tuning and optimization techniques using V8.
  - Embedding Node.js into a C++ application.
  - Advanced debugging using the Node.js Inspector and Performance hooks.
  - Understanding memory management and optimizing garbage collection in the V8 engine.
- **Outcome:** By completing this challenge, youâ€™ll learn how to extend Node.js functionality with native code, enabling low-level system optimization and performance improvements.

## Challenge 4: Develop a Fault-Tolerant Distributed System Using Node.js Clustering

- **Objective:** Build a distributed system capable of handling high traffic, implementing a robust fault-tolerant mechanism.
- **Skills to Focus On:**
  - Deep dive into Node.js Cluster for scaling the application across CPU cores.
  - Implementing advanced load balancing strategies beyond the default round-robin.
  - Handling worker crashes gracefully and restarting without downtime.
  - Integrating diagnostics and monitoring tools to track application health.
  - Building a zero-downtime deployment pipeline for seamless updates.
- **Outcome:** Youâ€™ll master advanced clustering techniques and learn how to create fault-tolerant distributed systems that can handle high loads efficiently.

## Challenge 5: Build a Complete Node.js-Based System Programming Tool

- **Objective:** Create a command-line tool that interacts with the OS, processes data, and handles networking operations.
- **Skills to Focus On:**
  - Using the OS, Net, and Cluster modules to interact with the system and handle network communication.
  - Implementing asynchronous operations with Promises, Async/Await, and Async Hooks.
  - Developing secure applications with Crypto and TLS/SSL.
  - Building diagnostic reports and handling deprecated APIs.
  - Integrating SQLite for data management and creating single executable applications.
- **Outcome:** This challenge will help you become proficient in building system-level tools, understanding Node.js internals, and mastering the event-driven architecture.

## Key Benefits of These Challenges:
