- **Globals** – Understand Node.js global objects (like `__dirname`, `process`, etc.).
- **Modules: CommonJS modules** – Learn how Node.js modules work, especially CommonJS (require/export).
- **Modules: ECMAScript modules** – Get familiar with ES6 modules (`import/export`).
- **File System (fs)** – Learn file handling (reading, writing, updating) using the `fs` module.
- **Path** – Manage and work with file paths in a platform-agnostic way.
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – Learn how to create basic HTTP and HTTPS servers.
- **Stream** – Understand data streams, reading from and writing to streams.
- **Buffer** – Learn how to handle binary data with buffers.

## 🔄 Asynchronous Programming

Focus on Node.js’s non-blocking architecture.

- **Events** – Study how event-driven programming works using `EventEmitter`.
